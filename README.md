# paymentSystem

This is a simple project I made in High School in 2021 in Netbeans with Java. 

It is meant to be a payment or ordering system. It comes with a graphical user interface, which can keep track of returning customers and print receipts. 
If the first and lastname matches with a former customer it will automatically fill in the rest of the order form as the customer ordered last time.

The GUI looks like this:
